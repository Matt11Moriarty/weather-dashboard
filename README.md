# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This dashboard was created so that anyone who want's to know the current weather of a city, as well as the five-day forecast, can do so!
If you are planning a trip, or are just curious, type in the name of the city who's weather you are interested in and it will be displayed automatically!

In building this dashboard, I became very comfortable working with third party API's such as openweathermap and fonts.google, and using the data they provide to generate dynamic applications. 
I also solidified my understanding of bootstrap, and put it to good use in building what I would consider a visually appealing interface.
